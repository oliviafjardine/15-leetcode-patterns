## ğŸ§  Daily Commitment

| Day | Suggested Focus |
|-----|------------------|
| Weekdays | 1â€“2 hrs: Learn + 1â€“2 problems |
| Weekends | 2â€“4 hrs: Deep practice + reviews |

### Example Daily Routine

## ğŸ“Œ Tips for Mastery

- Donâ€™t skip tracing your code or writing brute-force first
- Always ask: *Which pattern applies and why?*
- Track your progress in a Notion doc, GitHub repo, or journal
- Focus on **thinking in patterns**, not memorizing syntax
