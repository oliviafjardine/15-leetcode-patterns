## ‚úÖ Week 1: Python Fundamentals for LeetCode

**Goal**: Build minimal Python fluency to read and write LeetCode solutions.

### Topics
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Functions & recursion
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- String manipulation
- List/dict comprehensions
- Exception handling
- I/O basics

### Practice
- HackerRank Python Track
- [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com) (visualize code flow)

- Stacks/queues: `collections.deque`
- Heaps: `heapq`
- Custom classes and `__lt__`
- Functions: `sorted`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `filter`

### Practice
- Implement stack, queue, min/max heap
- Build a basic trie
- LeetCode Easy Top 50 (focus on implementation)
